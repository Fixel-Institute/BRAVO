# UF Brain Recording Analysis and Visualization Online Platform (UF BRAVO Platform)

## Overview

University of Florida Brain Recording Analysis and Visualization Online (BRAVO) Platform is a Python-based data analysis tool for processing and analyzing session data collected with sensing-enabled neurostimulators such as Medtronic Percept neurostimulator.

The BRAVO Repository is an updated version when compared to the original BRAVO_SSR Repository, where developmental features are actively updated. 

The original BRAVO_SSR will be kept alive because it offers capabilities that might be desirable by others, such as Server-side Rendererd Figure Div using Django Template. However, future updates will be primarily focused on the React version for better code organization and figure templating. 

## Documentation
