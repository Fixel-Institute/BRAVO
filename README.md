# UF Brain Recording Analysis and Visualization Online Platform (UF BRAVO Platform)

## Overview

University of Florida Brain Recording Analysis and Visualization Online (BRAVO) Platform is a Python-based data analysis tool for processing and analyzing session data collected with sensing-enabled neurostimulators such as Medtronic Percept neurostimulator.

The BRAVO Repository is an updated version when compared to the original BRAVO_SSR Repository, where developmental features are actively updated. 

The original BRAVO_SSR will be kept alive because it offers capabilities that might be desirable by others, such as Server-side Rendererd Figure Div using Django Template. However, future updates will be primarily focused on the React version for better code organization and figure templating. 

## Documentation

Currently, the active documentation generated by docs folder will be published at [https://bravo-documentation.jcagle.solutions/](https://bravo-documentation.jcagle.solutions/). 
The documentation written using Sphinx with Read-the-docs theme for both Python and Javascript libraries. More information will be described inside the documentation page.

## Front-end Host

Frontend webpage is designed to work with user's local database if the user only installed the Server without frontend. Check out the hosted page at [https://uf-bravo.jcagle.solutions/](https://uf-bravo.jcagle.solutions/) where you simply adjust the Server Host IP to your localhost to use your local database.

## Feature Requests and BUG Report
