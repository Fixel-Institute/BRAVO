Version 2.0.0
===============================================

Overview
---------------------------------------------
UF Brain Recording and Analysis Visualization Online (BRAVO) Platform Version 2.0.0 is a complete revamp of the initial 
UF BRAVO software published at `BRAVO Demo Site <https://bravo.jcagle.solutions>`_. 
The initial site, written originally in March 2020, was completely written in Python Django Framework. 
The site uses both Django Template frontend and Django Server to provide an all-in-one package of the the system. 
However, there are limitations pertaining to server-side rendering (SSR) system, including loading speed and cache performance. 
In addition, the Django template files written combined both scripts and html sources in one dynamically rendered pages, 
leading to difficulty in reading and may not be easy for sharing and reuse.

Below are outlines of all the major changes made to the server since Version 1.0.0. 
Version 1.0.0 will continue to be hosted on `BRAVO SSR Repository <https://github.com/Fixel-Institute/BRAVO_SSR>`_ because, 
functionally speaking, it is a properly working software. However, features will not be continuously updated. 

Major Changes 
---------------------------------------------

.. topic:: 1. Separation of Server and Client - Server-side Rendering (SSR) to Static-site Generator (SSG)

  Client software is now isolated from the django server as a standalone application. 
  The client software is completely rewritten in **React.js** for better templating and rendering than Django template.
  The primary HTML template is based on the free `MUI Core <https://mui.com/core/>`_ library with a paid design using
  `Material Dashboard 2 Premium <https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard-pro-react>`_ by *Creative Tim*.
