Backend API Requests Documentation
=============================================

Overview
---------------------------------------------
The backend APIs are a series of available REST API endpoints that developer may interface with for data queries.
The knowledge about these endpoints are not required by average users, since all the request and communications are hidden from users.
However, these will likely come in handy for people who want to modify the backend or develope their own frontend pipelines.

There are many modules among the backend APIs, which can be divided based on functionalities. 


1. `Authentication Module`_ for User (Research/Admin/Mobile)
2. Queries Module (APIs.Queries) for database requests
3. Session Module (APIs.Session) for frontend user configurations.
